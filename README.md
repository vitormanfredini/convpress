# ConvPress

## File compression software using convolutions and genetic algorithm

This is a project I'm doing to study Python.
It's slow and not recomended for any type of production use.

Testes:

```
python3 -m tests.substitute_matches_for_byte
python3 -m tests.bytelist_bytestring_backandforth
```
